Sleep apnea is a universal issue when people fall asleep, it is caused by airway's closing. 
The most general feature is snoring. 
Of course it could be very dangerous for people because they are unconscious about it.
Our aim is develop a mobile app to save people from sleep apnea.

We found some reference on Google Scholar and this paper is a rich representitive one which 
shows sleep apnea could be implied by heart rate. The researcher collect some information of 
 15 consecutive patients aged around 53 years in the duration when they are detected in sleep apnea,
AHI and delta HRA are two instructive index. 
AHI is apnoea hypoponea index, means the number of times that sleep aponea happens in an hour.
delta HRA is the difference of heart rate during aponea in non-rapid eye movement sleep.
